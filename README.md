## Techative

## About us

Techative is a reality made up of two young guys. An AFC in computer science and a passion for programming, video editing and photography.

## What we do

We do `website` creation or `application` development. We also `build and repair computers` according to your preferences, from classic office computers to more elaborate and high performance PCs for heavy editing or gaming. Finally, we also throw ourselves into `video` creation and `photography`.

## Where to find us
